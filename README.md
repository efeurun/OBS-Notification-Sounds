# OBS Notification Sounds

Notification sounds for OBS events:
- Replay Buffer Save
- Screenshot Taken
- Recording Start
- Recording Stopped

Place the files in:
`C:\Program Files\obs-studio\data\obs-scripts\`
(or your user-level OBS scripts folder).

You can replace the wav files with any sounds you like, keeping the same filenames.
